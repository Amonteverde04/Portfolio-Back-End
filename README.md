# My portfolio

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the back end code of my portfolio. 

- Framework: ExpressJS
- Deployment: Heroku
- Database: MongoDB

It consists of a simple POST request that sends a user's first name, email, and feedback once submitted to a MongoDB for me to read. 

## Accessing the site

You can access the project here:

I look forward to adding more back end features to this side of the project in the future.
